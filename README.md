# **tensorCSP**

tensorCSP is a small collection of Python functions for casting constraint satisfaction problems into tensor networks and algorithms for the full contraction of the resulting tensor networks. Concepts from algorithmic graph theory and network theory, namely graph partitioning and community structure detection, are used to determine advantageous contraction sequences for arbitrary graphs of tensors.

# **Prerequisites**

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [igraph](http://igraph.org/python/)
* [METIS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview)
* [METIS for Python](https://metis.readthedocs.io)

The respective websites provide instructions on installation of the above prerequisites.

# **Installation**

None needed. Just launch an [ipython](https://ipython.org) terminal (recommended) in the directory of tensorCSP and execute:
```
run tensorcsp.py
```

# **Documentation**

The scripts are commented and an example script is provided that illustrates some of the functionality.
